The Custom Contact Form WordPress Plugin is a simple and customizable solution for adding a contact form to your WordPress website. This plugin allows users to easily integrate a contact form into their pages or posts using a shortcode. We have recently tested it on our client [Sassa status check](https://easystatuscheck.com/) website.

- Submissions are processed and sent via email (customize email settings as needed).

## Installation

2. Upload the entire `custom-contact-form` folder to your WordPress plugins directory (`wp-content/plugins/`).
3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface.
